# Association Test for Rare Variants Based on Algebraic Statistics (ASRV)
Function for association test for rare variants based on algebraic statistics is ASRV. This method provides a novel association test for rare variants based on a generalization of Fisherâ€™s exact test, and the p-value of this exact test can be computed under the hypergeometric distribution in the framework of algebraic statistics.
